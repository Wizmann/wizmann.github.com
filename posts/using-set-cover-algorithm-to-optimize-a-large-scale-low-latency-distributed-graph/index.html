Here we just talk about the &ldquo;Graph Distance&rdquo; problem.</p><p><img src=https://github.com/Wizmann/assets/raw/master/wizmann-pic/15-7-25/24130302.jpg alt></p><p>The <em>Graph DB</em> stores all the relationship of the members.

And no de-duplicate is needed, because there&rsquo;s definitely no duplicate data in one single node of the database.</p><p>We can make a conclusion that if we have a <strong>wise</strong> load balancer, we can optimize our retrieval logic remarkably.</p><h2 id=set-cover-problem>Set Cover Problem</h2><blockquote><p>Given a set of elements {1,2,&mldr;,m} (called the universe) and a set S of n sets whose union equals the universe, the set cover problem is to identify the smallest subset of S whose union equals the universe. (Wikipedia)</p></blockquote><p>This problem is similar to ours. The optimal algorithm for a load balancer is to find the minimal subsets of all sets which union equals to the ones that asked by the query input.</p><p>It seems that we find the key to our problem. But this is NP-complete. There is no effective way to find the optimal solution.</p><p>However, in practice, a greedy algorithm will actually do the trick. The rule of the greedy algorithm is to find the set which contains largest number uncovered elements.</p><p><img src=https://github.com/Wizmann/assets/raw/master/wizmann-pic/15-7-26/80102455.jpg alt></p><h2 id=conclusion>Conclusion</h2><p>We finally find out that the social information and the relationship graph is <strong>not that difficult</strong>. The basic concepts are quite easy. And the main work for the whole system is to use the cache to reduce the amount of calculation on the fly.</p><p><img src=https://github.com/Wizmann/assets/raw/master/wizmann-pic/15-7-26/65691084.jpg alt></p><h2 id=reference>Reference</h2><p>This post is mainly based on this <a href=https://www.usenix.org/conference/hotcloud13/workshop-program/presentations/wang target=_blank rel=noopener>video</a>.</p><p><a href=https://www.usenix.org/sites/default/files/conference/protected-files/wang_hotcloud13_slides.pdf target=_blank rel=noopener>Slides</a></p><p>Special thanks to Linkedin for the sharing. :)</p></div></div><footer class="py-3 mt-auto bg-light"><div class="container py-1 my-1"><div class="d-flex flex-wrap justify-content-between align-items-center"><p class="col-md mb-0 text-muted"></p><ul class="nav col-md-auto justify-content-end"></ul></div></div></footer><script src=/js/main.min.e8d88c82c0438b527f1aca4115652ba1e2877bf805b75593b23ac0e3fe2b3fe95a467d1feef275355132ba061da6404b0d24d55afabc209b294b1db043be014d.js integrity="sha512-6NiMgsBDi1J/GspBFWUroeKHe/gFt1WTsjrA4/4rP+laRn0f7vJ1NVEyugYdpkBLDSTVWvq8IJspSx2wQ74BTQ==" crossorigin=anonymous defer></script></body></html>

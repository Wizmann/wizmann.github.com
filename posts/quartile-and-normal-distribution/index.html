The value of <em>inner fence</em> is <code>Q1 - 1.5 * IQR</code> and <code>Q3 + 1.5 * IQR</code>. At the same time, the value of <em>outer fence</em> is <code>Q1 + 3 * IQR</code> and <code>Q3 + 3 * IQR</code>.</p><p>The data outside the fence is called the <em>suspected outliers</em> and <em>outliners</em>.</p><p>If the data happens to be normally distributed, <code>IQR = 1.35Ïƒ</code>. It means that only 0.52% of the set of data should be out of the <em>inner fence</em> and hardly any of the data should be out of the <em>outer fence</em>. As a result, if a data is considered as a <em>outliners</em>, it is largely an exception.</p><p><img src=https://github.com/Wizmann/assets/raw/master/wizmann-tk-pic/Boxplot.png alt="Boxplot and Normal Distribution"></p><h2 id=reference>Reference</h2><ul><li><a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxplot target=_blank rel=noopener>Box plot - Wikipedia</a></li><li><a href=http://www.physics.csbsju.edu/stats/box2.html target=_blank rel=noopener>Box Plot: Display of Distribution</a></li><li><a href=http://www.wasu.com.cn/fwyzc/wasubzhzl/201207/P020140102519718744101.pdf target=_blank rel=noopener>Tables for statistical distributions</a></li></ul></div></div><footer class="py-3 mt-auto bg-light"><div class="container py-1 my-1"><div class="d-flex flex-wrap justify-content-between align-items-center"><p class="col-md mb-0 text-muted"></p><ul class="nav col-md-auto justify-content-end"></ul></div></div></footer><script src=/js/main.min.e8d88c82c0438b527f1aca4115652ba1e2877bf805b75593b23ac0e3fe2b3fe95a467d1feef275355132ba061da6404b0d24d55afabc209b294b1db043be014d.js integrity="sha512-6NiMgsBDi1J/GspBFWUroeKHe/gFt1WTsjrA4/4rP+laRn0f7vJ1NVEyugYdpkBLDSTVWvq8IJspSx2wQ74BTQ==" crossorigin=anonymous defer></script></body></html>

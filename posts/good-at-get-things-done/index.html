First, let’s break “getting things done” into two components: “excellent functional skills” and “drive”. Someone with great functional skills but poor drive will not get (enough) things done. Someone with great drive but poor functional skills will not get things done, or they’ll do the wrong things, or they’ll do the right things shittily.

Excellent functional skills

You can probe for domain knowledge and functional skills effectively in an interview or on a phone call. You come up with a list of role-specific responsibilities, probe deeply (several levels below the surface) into past examples where they’ve done similar work, and give them example challenges and see how they perform. You can make allowances for language or tool by letting them pick the language or tool of their choice, but don’t give them a pass on accomplishing the task set forth."><meta name=author content="wizmann"><link rel=canonical href=https://wizmann.top/posts/good-at-get-things-done/><link crossorigin=anonymous href=/assets/css/stylesheet.f49d66caae9ea0fd43f21f29e71a8d3e284517ed770f2aa86fa012953ad3c9ef.css integrity="sha256-9J1myq6eoP1D8h8p5xqNPihFF+13Dyqob6ASlTrTye8=" rel="preload stylesheet" as=style><link rel=icon href=https://wizmann.top/favicon.ico><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=https://wizmann.top/favicon-16x16.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=https://wizmann.top/favicon-32x32.png><link rel=apple-touch-icon href=https://wizmann.top/apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=mask-icon href=https://wizmann.top/safari-pinned-tab.svg><meta name=theme-color content="#2e2e33"><meta name=msapplication-TileColor content="#2e2e33"><link rel=alternate hreflang=zh-cn href=https://wizmann.top/posts/good-at-get-things-done/><noscript><style>#theme-toggle,.top-link{display:none}</style><style>@media(prefers-color-scheme:dark){:root{--theme:rgb(29, 30, 32);--entry:rgb(46, 46, 51);--primary:rgb(218, 218, 219);--secondary:rgb(155, 156, 157);--tertiary:rgb(65, 66, 68);--content:rgb(196, 196, 197);--code-block-bg:rgb(46, 46, 51);--code-bg:rgb(55, 56, 62);--border:rgb(51, 51, 51)}.list{background:var(--theme)}.list:not(.dark)::-webkit-scrollbar-track{background:0 0}.list:not(.dark)::-webkit-scrollbar-thumb{border-color:var(--theme)}}</style></noscript><script async src="https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=G-2X5NE9PX0B"></script><script>window.dataLayer=window.dataLayer||[];function gtag(){dataLayer.push(arguments)}gtag("js",new Date),gtag("config","G-2X5NE9PX0B")</script><meta property="og:url" content="https://wizmann.top/posts/good-at-get-things-done/"><meta property="og:site_name" content="Maerlyn's Rainbow"><meta property="og:title" content='Quora - What are effective ways to assess if someone is good at "getting things done"?'><meta property="og:description" content=" Ian McAllister, GM at Amazon.

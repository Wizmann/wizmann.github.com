&lt;p>This problem is from the book &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href="http://book.douban.com/subject/19952400/">Algorithm 4th edition&lt;/a>&amp;rdquo; (Exersise 4.1.10)&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>There are N cities and M undirected roads between those cities. People can travel to any city along the roads.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One day, a war breaks out. Our cities are under attack! As we can&amp;rsquo;t defend all these N cities, the commander wants you to find the least important city, which means that if this city fell to the enemy, the traffic among other cities would not be affected.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>

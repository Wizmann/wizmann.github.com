&lt;p>First, let’s break “getting things done” into two components: “excellent functional skills” and “drive”. Someone with great functional skills but poor drive will not get (enough) things done. Someone with great drive but poor functional skills will not get things done, or they’ll do the wrong things, or they’ll do the right things shittily.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Excellent functional skills&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>You can probe for domain knowledge and functional skills effectively in an interview or on a phone call. You come up with a list of role-specific responsibilities, probe deeply (several levels below the surface) into past examples where they’ve done similar work, and give them example challenges and see how they perform. You can make allowances for language or tool by letting them pick the language or tool of their choice, but don’t give them a pass on accomplishing the task set forth.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
